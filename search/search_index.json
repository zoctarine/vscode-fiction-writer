Easy Paragraph Creation \u00b6 fictionWriter.edit.easyParagraphCreation To create paragraphs in markdown, you need to add an extra empty line. That, usually, means pressing Enter key twice. With this setting, you can easily create new paragraphs by hitting one key only (or a combination). It has two options: Enter : pressing Enter once will add two line-breaks, and pressing Shift + Enter will add one line-break. Shift+Enter : pressing Enter once will add one line-break, but Shift + Enter will add two line-breaks. Writing Dialogues \u00b6 This is a proposed solution for writing dialogue. In some languages, dialogue is not marked by quotation marks, but is marked only at the beginning a dialogue line. For example, each line can start with em-dash (\u2014), like so: The Time Machine, by H. G. Wells \u2014 You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future? said Filby. \u2014 Into the future or the past. I don\u2019t, for certain, know which. After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. \u2014 It must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere, he said. Markdown can convert three dashes to em-dash and two dashes to en-dash. However, typing three dash character and one space is not necessarly convenient when writing lots of dialogue lines. A widespread practice is to write -- for an em-dash , and the text editor will automatically replace it. Selecting dialogue punctuation: \u00b6 fictionWriter.editDialogue.marker \"Hello,\" (quotes) default \u2014 Hello, (em-dash followed by one space) -- Hello , (two dashes followed by one space) --- Hello, (three dashes followed by one space) \u2014Hello, (em-dash, no space) --Hello, (two dashes, no space) ---Hello, (three dashes, no space With this feature, you can controlsthe punctuation used when writing dialogue. The following options are possible: Quotes: \"Hello,\" John said. ( default : this is equivalent with disabling all proposed dialogue features) Em-dash followed by one space: \u2014 Hello, John said. Two dashes followed by one space: -- Hello, John said. Three dashes followed by one space: --- Hello, John said. Em-dash, no space: \u2014Hello, John said. Two dashes, no space: -- Hello, John said. Three dashes, no space: --- Hello, John said. Once a dialogue marker is selected (other than quotes), the paragraph starting with that marker will be recognized as a dialogue paragraph enabeling other dialogue related features, like text formatting, auto replace, etc. Auto-replace dialogue markers \u00b6 fictionWriter.editDialogue.markerAutoReplace If enabled, typing -- followed by a space will insert the selected marker. Disable this feature if you do not want to auto-replace markers. Easily create new dialogue paragraphs \u00b6 Selecting a dialogue marker (other than quotes) changes the Easy Paragraph Creation behaviour as follows: if new paragraph is created (either by Shift + Enter or by Enter ), and is from a dialogue paragraph (meaning, the paragraph starts with a marker), then the next paragraph will automatically start with the selected dialogue marker. This makes writing alternative dialogue lines much faster. when hitting new line, if the only thing on that line is a dialogue marker, is automatically deleted. when hitting backspace, and the only thing in front of the cursor is the dialogue marker, the line will be cleared Using Dialgoue indents: \u00b6 Indent for sequential lines of the same dialogue paragraph. ( 0 for no indenting) This is especially useful when using the one sentence per line technique. Thus, having sentences from the same dialogue separated by simple line-breaks. -- Hi, said the first dialogue line. I am here, on multiple lines. -- Hi, said the other dialogue line. I am also here. The two lines continued their chat. fictionWriter.editDialogue.sentenceIndent The indent can be manually set under Edit Dialouge - Sentence Indent . fictionWriter.editDialogue.sentenceIndentAutoDetect If Edit Dialogue: Sentence Indent Auto-Detect is enabled, the indent will be automatically calculated based on the selected dialogue marker, and the previous setting will be ignored. Example: -- Hi, this is a dialogue. It uses two dashes and one space. Thus, it has a 3 space indent. \u2014 Hi, this uses em-dash and one space. It has just a two space indent.","title":"Text Editing"},{"location":"edit/#disable-key-bindings","text":"fictionWriter.edit.disableKeybindings Disables the following keybindings added by this extension: - Enter , Shift + Enter , Del , Backspace , Tab ) Note: If disabled , some of the other features, that depend or ar triggered by this keybindings will be disabled (eg. easy Paragraph Creation needs Enter end Shift + Enter in order to work properly).","title":"Disable Key-bindings"},{"location":"edit/#easy-paragraph-creation","text":"fictionWriter.edit.easyParagraphCreation To create paragraphs in markdown, you need to add an extra empty line.

Requirements \u00b6 Important! If you want to compile .md to other document formats using this extension, you need to have Pandoc installed on your machine, and configured to run from command line! Pandoc is a universal document converter, that understands a large number of useful markdown syntax extensions, including document metadata (title, author, date); footnotes; tables; etc. You can get it from here: Installing pandoc . You can test that pandoc is properly installed by opening your prefered command-line app and running: pandoc --version You should get an output similar to: pandoc 2.11.4 Compiled with pandoc-types 1.22, texmath 0.12.1, skylighting 0.10.2, citeproc 0.3.0.5, ipynb 0.1.0.1 User data directory: C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\AppData\\Roaming\\pandoc Copyright (C) 2006-2021 John MacFarlane. Web: https://pandoc.org This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is no warranty, not even for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Markdown flavors - COMING IN NEXT ALPHA RELEASE \u00b6 As exporting is done by using Pandoc, all Pandoc related markdown flavors can be used. Note that Pandoc already includes a list of enabled extensions. You can read more about these here Pandoc's Markdown . There are some extensions that are not included by default, but they can be enabled via settings panel. Read more about the following extensions here: Non Pandc Extensions attributes : allows attributes to be attached to any inline or block-level element. old_dashes : Selects the pandoc <= 1.8.2.1 behavior for parsing smart dashes: - before a numeral is an en-dash, and -- is an em-dash. This option only has an effect if smart is enabled. angle_brackets_escapable : Allow < and > to be backslash-escaped lists_without_preceding_blankline : Allow a list to occur right after a paragraph, with no intervening blank space. four_space_rule : Selects the pandoc <= 2.0 behavior for parsing lists, so that four spaces indent are needed for list item continuation paragraphs. spaced_reference_links : Allow whitespace between the two components of a reference link, for example, hard_line_breaks : Causes all newlines within a paragraph to be interpreted as hard line breaks instead of spaces. ignore_line_breaks : Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks. east_asian_line_breaks : Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks emoji : Parses textual emojis like as Unicode emoticons. tex_math_single_backslash : Causes anything between \\( and \\) to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between \\[ and \\] to be interpreted as display TeX math. tex_math_double_backslash : Causes anything between \\\\( and \\\\) to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between \\\\[ and \\\\] to be interpreted as display TeX math. markdown_attribute : Markdown is only parsed inside block-level tags if the tags have the attribute markdown=1 . mmd_title_block : Enables a MultiMarkdown style title block at the top of the document. If pandoc_title_block or yaml_metadata_block is enabled, it will take precedence over mmd_title_block . abbreviations : Parses PHP Markdown Extra abbreviation keys, like autolink_bare_uris : Makes all absolute URIs into links, even when not surrounded by pointy braces <...>. mmd_link_attributes : Parses multimarkdown style key-value attributes on link and image references. This extension should not be confused with the link_attributes extension. mmd_header_identifiers : Parses multimarkdown style heading identifiers (in square brackets, after the heading but before any trailing #s in an ATX heading). compact_definition_lists : Activates the definition list syntax of pandoc 1.12.x and earlier. gutenberg : Use Project Gutenberg conventions for plain output: all-caps for strong emphasis, surround by underscores for regular emphasis, add extra blank space around headings. sourcepos : Include source position attributes when parsing commonmark. For elements that accept attributes, a data-pos attribute is added; other elements are placed in a surrounding Div or Span elemnet with a data-pos attribute. Including other documents \u00b6 Export > Include: Enabled Key: fictionWriter.export.include.enabled Enables the include file functionality Default: enabled This extension adds support for combining multiple markdown documents into one. You can use the following syntax {file_to_include.md} the the contents of file_to_include.md will be added in the exported document. Specifying included files can be done in multiple ways. Include by aboslute or relative path \u00b6 A valid path to the file: like a relative path { my_file.md } or { relative/path/to/my_file.md } or an absolute path { c : \\MyBook\\Chapter1\\my_file.md } Include by metadata id \u00b6 This is the recommended way to include files, as it does not depend on the filename If the document has a metadata block with id top level field, this can be used in the include file syntax {} For example, if my_file.md has the following contents: --- id : prologue --- Prologue begins here... You can include it in another file like this: # Prologue { prologue } Resolve document id \u00b6 Export > Include: Search Document Ids in All Opened Files And Workspaces Key: fictionWriter.export.include.searchDocumentIdsInAllOpenFilesAndWorkspaces Default: disabled if you opt to include a file by id , and not by relative or absolute path, you have the option to search for that id only in the document workspace folder, or in all opened documents or worskpaces in Visual Studio Code. By default, this option is disabled Include errors \u00b6 Export > Include: Show Errors in Output File Key: fictionWriter.export.include.showsErrorInOutputFile Adds errors to the compiled document. Default: enabled If, during the export process, some errors occured, they will be shown in a warning message before the actual export takes place. You can choose to continue (with errors) or cancel the operation. By default, include errors are visible in the exported document in Error paragraphs, like this: Disable this option if you want to never see errors in exported document. The toc document \u00b6 A common practice is to have just one TOC document, where you include all other documents. A simple toc.md document can look like this: { chapter01.md } { chapter02.md } { chapter03.md } { chapter04.md } This will include all 4 referenced files. Of course a TOC document can contain any additional markdown syntax: # My Book Title ## Preface Some opening words ## Chapter One {chapter01.md} ## Chapter Tso {chapter02.md} ## The End This is the end. If {chapter01.md} does not exist, you will get a warning message, but the exporting can still continue with the other documents. For example, the toc.md from the following directory: . \u251c\u2500 toc.md \u251c\u2500 prologue.md \u251c\u2500 part1 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 ch1.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500 ch2.md \u2502 \u2514\u2500 ch3.md \u251c\u2500 part2/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 ch4.md/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 ch5.md \u2514\u2500 epilogue.md could look like: {prologue.md} {part1\\ch1.md} {part1\\ch2.md} {part1\\ch3.md} {part2\\ch4.md} {part2\\ch5.md} {epilogue.md} Commands \u00b6 Compile Current File \u00b6 documentation coming soon...

Metadata: Enabled Key: config.fictionWriter.metadata.enabled Enables/disables all metadata related features described in this section. Default: enabled Adding Metadata \u00b6 Fiction Writer understands yaml markdown metadata. To use metadata blocks with Fiction Writer , you need to: add the metadata block on the top of the document (no even an empty line before the beginning of text) separate the block with --- and end the block with --- or ... , each one on a separate line. follow yaml structure e.g. --- title : The Fictional Adventures of Fiction Writer status : draft tags : [ red , green , blue ] --- It was a cold and starry night... Note As this extension uses Pandoc to export documents, keep in mind that Pandoc also parses, and understands, markdown metadata. Read more about what kind of metadata is supported by Pandoc here: Metadata blocks . Terminology \u00b6 In the context of metadata, this extension uses the following wording: metadata category : the label/fieldname on the 1 st level of metadata. metadata keyword : any word in the label/field value of a metadata category, anyware in the metadata tree. in the following example, title , status and tags are metadata categories , and draft , red , green , blue , Main Title are keywords : --- title : Main Title status : draft tags : [ red , green , blue ] --- Known Metadata \u00b6 You can add any metadata category or keyword, but some categories are recognized (and used) by Fiction Writer : id category: used to uniquely identify a file during include/export process . You can either specify a file by path/filename or by this metadata id property. --- id : myFile --- My file contents... More information here . summary category: used to show a short description in Explorer tooltip and in the Metadata View as the first message above metadata tree. --- summary : Where we find about the summary category. --- My file contents... The Metadata View \u00b6 For all known documents (in this case, markdown) that contain yaml metadata, the Metadata View will be enabled in the Explorer . The view parses known metadata, and displays it as a tree. It optionally can include icons, or colors. yaml Exceptions \u00b6 Easy Lists \u00b6 Metadata: Easy Lists Key: fictionWriter.metadata.easyLists Under Metadata: Easy Lists , you can configure if you want to split metadata values by a specific character. The default value is comma ( , ), that means each comma separated item will be treated as a list item. To disable this setting, just leave the Metadata: Easy Lists value blank. Although lists (arrays) in yaml are defined like: --- items : - item1 - item2 - item3 --- or like --- items : [ item1 , item2 , item3 ] --- to make writing lists easyer, Fiction Writer can split a text value into a list, by a configured item separator. So, the, previous example could be written like so: --- items : item1, item2, item3 --- if the separator is , . The separator is configurable under Metadata: Easy Lists . Note This is only if the category is a known category , meaning: the category is added to the Category icons list, explained below. Spaces are not trimmed If this feature does not behave as expected, make sure that the separator value does not include unwanted spaces. Especially at the beginning or end. Default categories \u00b6 Metadata: Default Category Key: fictionWriter.metadata.defaultCategory You can configure the default category you want uncategorized items to be assigned to. To disable this feature, just leave the default category name empty. If you quickly want to categorize a document, you can write only the keyword or keywords between the metadata block markers, like so: --- item1, item2, item3 --- or even --- draft --- This will automatically add these items to the configured Default Category e.g. If the Default Category is status , then the above blocks will be similar to: --- status : [ item1 , item2 , item3 ] --- --- status : draft --- Icons \u00b6 Metadata > Categories: Icons Key: fictionWriter.metadata.categories.icons Predefined category icons, with the possiblity to add any number of new ones. Sets icons for categories in the Metadata View . Only icons from VSCode Product Icon Reference are supported. Add your custom category name to the Metadata > Categories: Icons list ( Item ) and set it's value to the icon id from Product Icon Reference. (Eg. tag , eye , book ). There are some predefined icons and categories. If you want, you can easily change any predefined icon by editing it's value. All categories from this list, are treated as known categories . This means, they will support the Easy Lists functionality. Note If you just want to add a category as known category , add it to this list, but leave the Icon ( Value ) field empty. Disable category icons or names \u00b6 You can completely disable icons, by unchecking Metadata > Category: Show Icons Metadata > Categories: Show Icons Key: fictionWriter.metadata.categories.showIcons Shows category icons in the Metadata view.
